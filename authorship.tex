Moreover, I confirm that the paper at hand was not submitted in this or similar form at another examination office, nor has it been published before.

With my signature I explicitly approve that HHL will use an internet-based plagiarism detector which screens electronic text files and looks for similar pieces on open-access websites as well as similarities in work previously submitted.
